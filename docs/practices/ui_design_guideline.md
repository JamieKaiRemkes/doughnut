# UI Design Guideline

## Use DaisyUI

Many places in the current design are using Bootstrap and custom CSS. But we are gradually converting to DaisyUI, and make custom CSS as less as possible. At least, the custom CSS should be netural and compatible with the themes.

* Use "daisy-*" prefix for the classes.
